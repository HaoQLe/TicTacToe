# TicTacToe

I built TicTacToe from scratch in Java.

1. The game is played on 3 by 3 board.

2. Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty slots on the board.

3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When the board is full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
