# TicTacToe

I built TicTacToe from scratch in Java.

To win in TicTacToe, 2 players must take turns making marks with either "X" or "O" depending on whose turn it is. 
Whoever is able to get 3 in a row first will be the winner. If there are no winners after the board is completely filled,
then it is a tie.
